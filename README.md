# StimMusic - Music + GVS

Experience music and vestibular stimulation in sync. Artists can write music with vestibular stimulation channel using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) plugin Virtual Studio Technology (VST). A 4-electrode GVS setup allows for stimulation of yaw, pitch, and roll vestibular experience, at various intensities, in sync with music.

## Safety

Nominal: 0 - 4mA @ 9V
Max: 6mA @ 9V

Proper system should have current limiter! Better, multiple redundant current limiter! Don't connect to mains, use a battery!

## Electrode Placement

Electrodes tested at

2 seperate current pathways, so that current doesn't go across the forehead.
   - "Because SDAS and ODAS are applied using two current stimulators (A+/- and B+/-), a part of current emitted from anode A+ may be received by cathode B- when ground-sharing circuits are used. Then, current might not flow as we intended. Therefore, we used isolated current stimulators that were driven by a different battery." 

Each electrode must be able to be cathod or anode.

1. Left mastoid.
2. Right mastoid
3. Left temple
4. Right temple

Ensure there is no current flow from 3 to 4!

## Electrical

3 isolated bipolar circuits, in order to show ensure current flows as expected.

1. Mastoid-mastoid
2. Left mastoid - left temple
3. Right mastoid - right temple

How? 3 batteries, three H-

## Subjective Experience 

Yaw, pitch, roll are the primary colors of the vestibular system.

How can we make it feel like we're flying up? Or dropping into the ground? Or accelerating forward so we are pushed back into our chair?

Left roll - 1 cathode, 2 anode 
Right roll - 1 anode, 2 cathod

Front pitch - 1 anode, 3 cathode, 2 anode, 4 cathode
Back pitch - 1 cathod, 3 anode, 2 cathode, 3 anode

Left yaw - 1 cathode, 2 anode, 3 anode, 4 cathode
Right yaw - 1 anode, 2 cathode, 3 cathode, 4 anode
